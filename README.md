# Context Free Grammar Designs

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing Context Free Grammars (CFGs). It includes custom CFGs in `.gr` files, showcasing various aspects of natural language processing and grammar parsing.

## Features
- Custom CFGs for diverse language structures.
- Implementation examples demonstrating CFG applications in parsing and language analysis.

## Files
- `.gr` files: Contain custom Context Free Grammars.
- Additional supporting scripts and documentation files.

## Tech Stack
- CFGs in language processing.
- Python for scripting and testing grammars.

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Python Standard Library.
